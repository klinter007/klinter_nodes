description: Implement an approved OpenSpec change and keep tasks in sync.

<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->
**Guardrails**
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `openspec/AGENTS.md` if you need additional OpenSpec conventions or clarifications.

**Steps**
1. Read `changes/<id>/proposal.md`, `design.md` (if present), and `tasks.md` to confirm scope and acceptance criteria.
2. Work through tasks sequentially, keeping edits minimal and focused on the requested change.
3. Mark each task `- [x]` immediately after completing it to keep the checklist in sync.
4. Reference `openspec list` or `openspec show <item>` when additional context is required.

**Reference**
- Use `openspec show <id> --json --deltas-only` if you need additional context from the proposal while implementing.
